# Web5 Improvement Proposals (WIPs)

This repository contains Web5 Improvement Proposals (WIPs) that describe standards and protocols for the web5 ecosystem. WIP also means *Working-in-Progress*, which coincidentally indicates that there is always a way to discuss and improve the web5 idealism.

Web5 is a set of protocols that provides decentralized identity with application solutions. It combines the decentralized nature of web3 with the user experience of web2, enabling users to own their identity and control their data without sacrificing usability.
